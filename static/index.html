      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>This web-based educational tool is a collection of pictures assembled to help patients and others in the lay public recognize dysplastic nevi and melanomas that started in dysplastic nevi.  Dysplastic nevi (DN) are atypical moles that are important risk markers for melanoma, and precursor lesions for some melanomas.</p>
      <p>The tool includes 30 different lesions, almost all photographed over multiple points in time and shown in up to five sequential pictures.  The pictures and accompanying clinical descriptions show the various phases in the spectrum of pigmented lesions typically seen in U.S. melanoma-prone families: normal common acquired nevi; dysplastic nevi (DN); and melanomas that arose in DN.</p>
      <h4>Acknowledgements</h4>
      <p>The tool was developed by research clinicians and an epidemiology program analyst at the National Cancer Institute. We would like to thank the study participants whose pictures are included in this tool for their participation in the study over many years, their willingness to have their pictures taken during many skin examinations, and their generosity in allowing their pictures to be included. We would also like to thank John Crawford and Mary King, Clinical Center patient photographers, for their expertise. The tool would not have been possible without the substantial commitment and cooperation of both the study participants and the patient photographers.</p>
      <h4>More Information</h4>
      <p>For further information about the study “Clinical, Laboratory, and Epidemiologic Characterization of Individuals and Families at High Risk of Melanoma”, please see: <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00040352">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00040352</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="noninteractive" ng-show="about">
      <h2>About the Tool</h2>
      <p>The pictures in the tool are organized in 3 main sections: <a href="javascript:void(0);" ng-click="filterClick(getFilterByName('mole'),true)">common moles</a>; <a href="javascript:void(0);" ng-click="filterClick(getFilterByName('dysplasticnevi'),true)">dysplastic nevi (DN)</a>; and <a href="javascript:void(0);" ng-click="filterClick(getFilterByName('melanoma'),true)">melanomas</a> that arose in DN. The Dysplastic Nevi section is subdivided into: stable and fading DN, and DN evolving toward melanoma. The pictures show the various phases in the spectrum of pigmented lesions typically seen in U.S. melanoma-prone families. As a teaching aid, this tool also includes the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/types/skin/moles-fact-sheet#q9" target="_new">“ABCDE” features</a> for each type of pigmented lesion (moles, DN, and melanomas).  Although the “ABCDE” rules were made for identifying early melanoma, they can also be used to describe DN. The tool also contains additional information and links to other resources about dysplastic nevi and the prevention and early detection of melanoma.</p>
      <h4>What is the "ABCDE" rule?</h4>
      <div>
        <span>The "ABCDE" rule describes the features of early melanoma. There are as follows:</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Asymmetry - The shape of one half does not match the other half.</li>
          <li>Border that is irregular - The edges are often ragged, notched, or blurred in outline. The pigment may spread into the surrounding skin.</li>
          <li>Color that is uneven - Shades of black, brown, and tan may be present. Areas of white, gray, red, pink, or blue may also be seen.</li>
          <li>Diameter - There is a change in size, usually an increase. Melanomas can be tiny, but most are larger than 6 millimeters wide (about 1/4 inch wide).</li>
          <li>Evolving - The mole has changed over the past few weeks or months.</li>
        </ul>

He captured strangers'  shocked reactions at viewing their faces in a way they never had before.  Leveritt also asked his subjects to apply sunscreen to show how under the  camera's filter, the white lotion shows up like black war paint.</span>

    <div class="disclaimer">
      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>The photographs of the moles and melanomas used in this collection were taken over a 35-year period. Thus, there may be variations in color among the pictures due to the differences in: photography equipment, supplies and methods used (e.g. types
        of cameras and color film, development and processing of film, use of digital photography when it became available); lighting in the many clinic rooms in which the pictures were taken; and skin color of the individual (e.g. whether or not his
        or her skin was sunburned or suntanned) at the time each of the pictures were taken. We have attempted, to the extent that we can, to standarize the pictures in each series without modifying the natural features of the lesions. To address the
        variations in relative size of the lesions, a ruler is included in each picture. When comparing the pictures within each of the cases series, it is important to use the rulers. In some series, the rulers in some pictures may be in different locations
        because of where the rulers were placed on the skin when each picture was taken.</p>
