    "description":"Over 16 years, this 8 mm wide dysplastic nevus increased minimally, but appeared larger (about 12 mm) when a tiny pink area nearby enlarged and grew together with the larger nevus. The larger nevus then appeared to have changed to a much more irregular shape.  It contained a mixture of brown colors, lighter on the flat base and darker on the raised pebbly surface.  The pebbly surface area enlarged and darkened before fading substantially as the mole flattened.   The indistinct borders became even more indistinct as the mole continued to fade.  The smaller attached mole became raised before fading to a pink papule (bump) which was barely visible.",
